# terrabot
Visualise &amp; play (or advise plays for) Terra Mystica.

## Organisation of repo
Currently, there are two main aspects to the repository: 
1. Visualising map in terms of distance from a faction's home terrain. To run this, clone the repo
   and enter `python visualisations/terravisgui.py`
2. Developing a model that learns which faction to pick based on starting information (round tiles,
   bonus tiles, other factions picked). This is in development.
